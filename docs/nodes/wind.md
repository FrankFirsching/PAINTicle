# Wind

The wind node is an interactive node, that simulates the effect of wind to the particles. The direction of the wind
is steered by the mouse/pen movements. This makes it more useful for the rain emitter instead of the brush emitter,
since mouse/pen movement is already used to define the location where the emitter creates the particles.
